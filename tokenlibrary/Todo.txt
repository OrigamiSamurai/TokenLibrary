Todo:

*Add ability do grab an image from image URL and display it on the page
*Add ability to upload a file to server
*Add ability to return URL of uploaded file, then use it to display the image

*Add ability to create a creature from a name and portrait URL (no cropping)

Investigate usage of token image URL (seems to be the same as portrait image URL for vader images)
--probably legacy from when original thought was to save portrait AND token images
--triviality of token generation makes this obsolete

Add ability to crop image when creating creature (this will involve saving the cropped image, generating a filename/path, and returning it to populate the creature model)
